## üîß Key Components

### Camera Management
```dart
CameraController _controller;
Future<void> _initializeControllerFuture;
```
- Handles camera initialization and disposal
- Supports front/back camera switching
- Resolution management for optimal performance

### Permission Handling
```dart
Future<void> _requestPermissions() async {
  final cameraStatus = await Permission.camera.request();
  final micStatus = await Permission.microphone.request();
}
```
- Runtime permission requests
- Graceful handling of permission denials
- User feedback for permission states

### State Management
- Local state management using `setState()`
- Screen-specific state isolation
- Timer management for call duration

## üåç Localization Implementation

The app uses a dictionary-based translation system:

```dart
final Map<String, Map<String, String>> _translations = {
  'English': { /* English translations */ },
  'Yoruba': { /* Yoruba translations */ },
  // ... other languages
};
```

### Adding New Languages
1. Add language name to `_languages` list
2. Add translation dictionary to `_translations`
3. Ensure all required keys are present

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Language switching works correctly
- [ ] Camera permissions are requested properly
- [ ] Video preview displays correctly
- [ ] Call controls function (mute, video toggle, camera switch)
- [ ] Navigation between screens works
- [ ] Screen reader announcements work (for accessibility testing)

### Device Testing
- Test on both Android and iOS devices
- Verify camera functionality on different device models
- Test with different screen sizes and orientations

## üì¶ Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera: ^0.10.0  # Camera functionality
  permission_handler: ^10.0.0  # Runtime permissions
```

### Dev Dependencies
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^2.0.0
```

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- No personal data storage
- Temporary camera access only during calls
- No video recording or storage
- Minimal permission requests

### Security Considerations
- Camera access restricted to call duration
- No background camera access
- Permission revocation handling

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real Backend Integration**: Connect to actual video calling service
- **User Authentication**: Optional account creation for regular volunteers
- **Call History**: Track successful connections (privacy-compliant)
- **Push Notifications**: Alert volunteers to incoming help requests
- **Geographic Matching**: Connect users with nearby volunteers
- **AI Description**: Automatic scene description for complex visual tasks

### Technical Improvements
- **WebRTC Integration**: For actual peer-to-peer video calling
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Scalable backend for user matching
- **Performance Optimization**: Better camera handling and memory management
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality when internet is limited
